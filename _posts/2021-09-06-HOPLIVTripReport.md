title: HOPL IV Trip Report
categories: [HOPL IV,Trip Report]
---

This trip report is a bit delayed, but better late than never. [HOPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages) stands for **History of Programming Languages** and is a conference that happens roughly once every 14 years. The past HOPL conferences happened in the following years:

* [1978 - HOPL I (Los Angeles, CA, USA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages#HOPL_I)
* [1993 - HOPL II (Cambride, MA, USA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages#HOPL_II)
* [2007 - HOPL III (San Diego, CA, USA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages#HOPL_III)
* [2021 - HOPL IV (Online)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages#HOPL_IV)

HOPL IV took place from June 20 to 22. HOPL IV was originally supposed to take place in 2020, but due to COVID it was postponed to 2021 and happened virtually.

## Highlights 

My top two favorite talks were the histories of [APL](https://www.pldi21.org/prerecorded_hopl.2.html) and [Clojure](https://www.pldi21.org/prerecorded_hopl.11.html). They were both great talks but I am also a bit biased because APL is my #1 favorite language and Clojure is my #3 favorite language. The other highlight of the conference were the conversations that took place in between the talks. I spent a lot of time talking with [Aaron Hsu](), author of [Co-dfns](https://www.google.com/search?q=co-dfns&oq=co-dfns&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61.1233j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), a GPU-accelerated APL compiler. At one point, we had a great group conversation with the following folks:

* Aaron Hsu, Dyalog, author of [Co-dfns](https://www.google.com/search?q=co-dfns&oq=co-dfns&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61.1233j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
* [Troels Henriksen](https://twitter.com/sigkill_dk), creator of [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/)
* [Adam Paszke](https://twitter.com/apaszke), Google, creator of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* Justin Slepak, Facebook, creator of [Remora](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13451)

Several folks asked if the discussion was recorded but sadly it was not. However, there is potential to reconvene the panel at some point or have them on [ArrayCast](https://www.arraycast.com/), a podcast on array languages that I host.

## Thank You

Thanks to the volunteers and organizers of the conference. It was great to meet and chat with programming language folks online.

Feel free to leave a comment on the [reddit thread]().
