Typically whenever I like a podcast episode, I will just tweet about it, like the examples below:

* [CoRecursive Episode 24 with Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1200112950586966016?s=20)
* [Functional Geekery Episode 128 with Gene Kim](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1199407456461316097?s=20)
* [NVIDIA AI Podcast Episode 100 with Ian Buck](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1185248371365142528?s=20)
* [CppCast Episode 237 with Barry Revzin](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1236362054715486209?s=20)

However, today's episode was so good that I decided a tweet was not enough - so I created a blog so I could have more than 140 charactes to share my thoughts.

### About CppCast

[CppCast](https://cppcast.com/) is one of the two main C++ podcasts and is hosted by [Rob Irving](https://twitter.com/robwirving) and [Jason Turner](https://twitter.com/lefticus). The other C++ podcast is [cpp.chat](https://cpp.chat/). The format of CppCast is to have a guest on and talk about a topic (typically relevant to the guest) with the guest. Before talking about said topic, they typically cover a few pieces of news from the C++ community and ecosystem.

### Episode 242 with Jonathon Turner

The guest for [Episode 242](https://cppcast.com/nu-programming-languages-jonathan-turner/) was [Jonathan Turner](https://twitter.com/jntrnr), who happens to be co-host Jason's brother. For anyone that is interested in programming languages - the podcast is a goldmine. I was going for my daily COVID walk and I couldn't stop smiling while I was listening to it. Here are my favorite quotes from the episode (some profound, some funny):

> Your ambitions will outrun your skill - and that is how you should start.

> There was so much more about programming that I wanted to learn so that I was always ready, I could always go deep and have really strong solutions to problems; that was really the impetus to study programming languages ... how do you think about programming, how do you do really good programming so that the code you write is very readable and crisp and clean

> I want to be a hobbit too.

Jonathon details his ~15 year history in programming languages. The highlights of the history are:

* Toy programming language he wrote called Pineapple
* His work with Jason on [Chaiscript](http://chaiscript.com/)
* Programming language he wrote called [Minnow](https://github.com/jonathandturner/minnow-language)
* Comparison of Minnow to Go
* Loved Minnow so much he quit his job and worked on it for 1.5 years
* Grad school research on programmings languages and concepts
* Work with Chris Lattner and Doug Gregor at **Apple**
* Work on the inherently parallel programming language [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/)
* Implemented concepts in Chapel
* Work as the PM for TypeScript while at **Microsoft**
* Work on Rust while at **Mozilla**

Hearing about Jonathon's career and experience and history was inspiring and it was 

### Flashback from the Past

I listen to about 15 programming / technology podcasts and I actually explicitly remember an episode from a different podcast that Jonathon Turner was on that I had listened to previously without knowing that he was Jason's brother. He was on [Episode 363](https://changelog.com/podcast/363) of [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/) podcast. I remember it vividly because I love hearing passionate people talking about what they are passionate about. If you want to here more about Nushell, definitely check this episode out. And for random trivia facts, I remmeber exactly where I was when I listened to the podcast - I was on W Campbell Ave in the midst of a ~50km bike ride back in Septemeber 2019 when I lived in Silicon Valley. Here is a image of the route I biked:

### Lang.Next Videos

Jonathon also mentioned Lang.Next during the podcast, which I had also come across in the past. I keep track of every talk / presentation / lecture I have watched and on May 1, 2019 I watched [LangNext 2014 (C++, Rust, D, Go)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBbv1ej0fFo) which is just a copy of the actual talk on Channel 9 [Panel: Systems Programming in 2014 and Beyond](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Panel-Systems-Programming-Languages-in-2014-and-Beyond)

It is a panel of four language designers:

* Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++)
* Andrei Alexandrescu (co-designed of D)
* Rob Pike (co-creator of Go)
* Niko Matsakis (core developer for Rust)

It is a fantastic panel and hearing Jonathon mention on the podcast reminded me that it was on my list of things to do to go back back and watch all of the talks. Jonathon mentioned on the podcast that he has given many talks, and you can find one of them: [TypeScript – Supersetting JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/TypeScript-Supersetting-JavaScript/) on Channel 9 from Lang.Next 2014:

He also tells an awesome story about himself, Bjarne, Niko and other Rust folks having dinner together at the conference and sharing stories - and how it led the Rust development team to internalize some of the lessons that Bjarne shared with them that he learned from creating C++ over previous decades. So absolutely cool to hear about that. And loved when Jonathon said:

> And once he [Stroustrup] realizes that we [the Rust team] actually like C++ and that we aren't just hear to dog on C++, we started to have this really awesome conversation about what it was like to design C++ over the years ...

This echos what I stated at the beginning of my lightning talks at Meeting C++ 2019 where I said:

> Not only should we be kind to them [developers in other programming languages], you should think about learning some of these languages.

It made me so happy to hear about C++ and Rust language designers sharing stories and learning from each other. That is so awesome.
