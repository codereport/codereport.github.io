Typically whenever I like a podcast episode, I will just tweet about it, like the examples below:

* [CoRecursive Episode 24 with Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1200112950586966016?s=20)
* [Functional Geekery Episode 128 with Gene Kim](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1199407456461316097?s=20)
* [NVIDIA AI Podcast Episode 100 with Ian Buck](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1185248371365142528?s=20)
* [CppCast Episode 237 with Barry Revzin](https://twitter.com/code_report/status/1236362054715486209?s=20)

However, today's episode was so good that I decided a tweet was not enough - so I created a blog so I could have more than 140 charactes to share my thoughts.
